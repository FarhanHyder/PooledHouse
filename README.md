# PooledHouse

An app to learn and share about service industry
> Developed as a course requirement for CSC.47300 - Website Design at CCNY by the team PooledHouse  
Hosted on AWS  
[See the app in action here](http://front-end-20190514132134-hostingbucket-phdev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)  

## To Run Tests  
> Just run the following command from the project root directory which is /PooledHouse/front-end/  
`npm test`  
Since all tests are run against the deployed version on AWS cloud [from here](http://front-end-20190514132134-hostingbucket-phdev.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/), running local server is not necessary
